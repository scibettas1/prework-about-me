      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a graphic designer learning web development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am currently living in Verona NJ, but I've moved around, and lived in many places.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love singing and writing music. I also like arts and crafts.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to own a graphic and web design business.This would also alow me to work
        remotely, so that I could be anywhere while I work. It would give me the ability to travel
        freely or tour with my band while I continue to make a living.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Verona, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think being a web developer goes hand in hand with being a graphic designer. I already know
        some basic coding and development. I'm hoping that this course will help me grow my skills
        and help me to move forward into the next phase of my life.
